# Image Carousel

## Summary

<!-- ![Dropdown Creation](./demo.png) -->

I am creating a custom image carousel to enhance the user experience with a responsive, visually appealing design.

<del>Hosted:

## Features

<!-- - **Consistent Style Matching**: The dropdown styling adapts automatically to dark and light themes. Simply use the same HTML structure, and the dropdown will match the theme seamlessly.
 - **Interactive Selection**: Users can easily select options with clear feedbackâ€”selected items highlight, and the dropdown updates to show the chosen option.
 - **Keyboard Accessibility**: Pressing the "Escape" key closes any open dropdown menu. -->

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, you need to fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button near the top right of this page. If you are unfamiliar with this process, please follow this GitHub [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Next, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command. Make sure to replace `your-username` with your GitHub username:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-carousel
```

### 3. Running the File

Once cloned, navigate to your project folder, locate the HTML file, and double-click it. This should open the file in your default browser.

Alternatively, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension and use it to launch the project by right-clicking on the HTML file and selecting **Open with Live Server**.

### 4. Have Fun

Feel free to add your own images and see how they go around.

## Challenges
<!-- 
- **Showing User Current Selection**: Ensuring that the selected item is highlighted within the dropdown.

- **Get User Choice**: Updating the displayed text to reflect the user's current selection.

- **Closing when interaction is Changed**: Implementing logic to close the dropdown when clicking outside or pressing "Escape".
