# Image Carousel

## Summary

![Image Carousel Creation](./demo.gif)

I have created a custom image carousel to enhance the user experience with a responsive, visually appealing design. The carousel supports smooth animations, navigation buttons, autoplay functionality, and fully responsive behavior across devices.

## Features

- **Smooth Animations:** Images transition seamlessly with CSS-based animations for an elegant user experience.
- **Autoplay with Pause/Play Control:** Automatically cycles through images, with an option for users to pause and resume the autoplay feature.
- **Navigation Buttons:** Easily navigate through images using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts to various screen sizes with CSS media queries.
- **Dot Indicators:** Includes clickable dots to show the user's current position in the carousel.
- **Dynamic Content:** Image URLs and content are dynamically handled via JavaScript, making it easy to customize.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, you need to fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button near the top right of this page. If you are unfamiliar with this process, please follow this GitHub [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Next, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command. Make sure to replace `your-username` with your GitHub username:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-carousel
```

### 3. Running the File

Once cloned, navigate to your project folder, locate the HTML file, and double-click it. This should open the file in your default browser.

Alternatively, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension and use it to launch the project by right-clicking on the HTML file and selecting **Open with Live Server**.

### 4. Adding Your Own Images

You can customize the carousel by replacing the image URLs in the HTML file or dynamically generating them in the JavaScript code. Images should be stored in the ./imgs folder and referenced appropriately.

### 5. Explore Features

Try out the navigation buttons, autoplay, and dot indicators to see how the carousel works. Use a smaller screen or resize your browser to test the responsiveness.

## Challenges

- **Animation Timing:** Ensuring smooth transitions without delays or flickering.
- **Autoplay Control:** Balancing autoplay timing while maintaining user interaction capabilities.
- **Dynamic Image Loading:** Creating a system that allows easy customization with minimal code changes.
